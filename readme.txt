BUZZYBEE
BY MARK WALKER


A game that started out as a Flappy bird clone but became something of its own!


You control buzz with the Up, Left, Right, and Down arrowkeys. 
You shoot projectiles from his location with the A key. 
(This is used for both core gameplay and maneuvering the game windows.)


From the title screen to the menu screen, you can jump straight into the game, 
view a tutorial to learn how to play, or even see the controls.


The game has 4 difficulties you can select. Easy, Medium, Hard, and IMPOSSIBLE; 
both the speed of the game and points earned per obstacle are 1, 2, 3, and 5, respectively. 
During gameplay, pillars will begin to randomly generate and move from the right side of 
the screen to the left; these pillars span the whole screen, but have a weak spot. 
The goal is to maneuver buzz into position to shoot out the weak spots of the pillars 
and fly through, gaining points for each successful bypass. 
You only have one life so if you collide with any part of the pillar, 
you lose and your final score is displayed!
